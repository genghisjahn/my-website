## Weekly Training Plan with Fallback Levels

This plan is designed to be **failure-tolerant**.  
The goal is consistency, not perfection.

If a full session does not happen, you **drop down a level**, not to zero.

---

## Weekly Structure (Anchor)

- **Monday / Wednesday / Friday:** Cardio
- **Tuesday / Thursday:** Strength
- **Weekend:** Off or optional easy walking

---

# CARDIO DAYS (MWF)

## Level 1 — Full Cardio Stack (Ideal)
- **Zone 2 run:** 20 minutes (outdoors)
- **Row erg:** 5 min on / 2 min rest / 5 min on (moderate, controlled)
- **Jump rope:**  
  - 1 min on  
  - 30 sec rest  
  - 1 min on

This is the target session.

---

## Level 2 — Anchor Only (Very Acceptable)
- **Zone 2 run:** 20 minutes

If this is all you do, the day **counts**.

---

## Level 3 — Indoor / Low-Friction
- **Row erg:** 12–15 minutes, continuous
- Easy to moderate pace
- No intervals

Use this when weather, time, or motivation blocks running.

---

## Level 4 — Bare Minimum (Non-Zero Day)
- **Row erg:** 6–8 minutes easy  
  **OR**
- **Brisk walk:** 10 minutes

Purpose: maintain habit and circulation.

---

### Cardio Rules
- Never “make up” missed cardio later
- Never skip because it “doesn’t count”
- Zone 2 stays truly easy

---

# STRENGTH DAYS (TR)

## Current Strength Pattern

**Pyramid ladders**

Exercises:
- Pull-ups  
- Weighted squats  
- Push-ups  
- Planks (seconds)

Current ladder:
- **1–5–1** (up to 5, then back down)  
- Progressing toward **1–6–1** over time

---

## Level 1 — Full Strength Session (Ideal)

- Complete the **full planned ladder** for all movements  
  (e.g. 1–5–1, progressing to 1–6–1)
- Controlled pace
- Normal rest between sets
- Stop immediately if form degrades

This is the session that drives primary strength progress.

---

## Level 2 — Anchor Strength Session (Highly Acceptable)

- Complete a **reduced ladder** for all movements  
  (e.g. **1–3–1 or 1–4–1**)
- Slower pace and/or longer rest as needed
- Stop immediately after completing the descent

This preserves consistency and movement quality while reducing total load.
It still counts as meaningful training.

---

## Level 3 — Partial Strength
Choose **one**:
- Pull-up pyramid only  
- Push-up pyramid only  

Focus on quality, not speed.

---

## Level 4 — “Just Touch It”
Choose one:
- 2–3 submax sets of pull-ups  
- 2–3 submax sets of push-ups  
- A single **1–4–1** pyramid

Purpose: joint signal and continuity.

---

### Strength Rules
- Do not add intensity to compensate for missed volume
- If elbows or shoulders feel off, stop early
- Missing volume is fine; missing weeks is not

---

# Simple Decision Rules

- **Time < 20 min:** Level 3 or 4
- **Energy < 5/10:** Level 2
- **Energy ≥ 7/10:** Level 1

No negotiation required.

---

# Core Principle

> Something easy today beats something perfect tomorrow.

The plan succeeds as long as:
- MWF remain cardio days
- TR remain strength days
- You never let “all or nothing” win

This is a system built to last.
