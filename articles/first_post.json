I'd been using Hugo for quite some time, but I'd go so long between posts that by the time I wanted to post again my templates wouldn't build on Netlify.  I thought about going all local with Hugo, but then when trying to select a template I kept coming across templates that didn't work or needed so many other dependencies just to build and then there's just learning all the Hugo stuff.  I think Hugo is great, but I don't need it for what I'm doing.  Anyway, I thought to myself, 'screw it, I'll just hand roll it.'  And then I thought some more and told ChatGPT what kind of engine I wanted and it made it for me.  It took three total prompts.  The first promopt gave me the directory structure and the code needed to build.  The second prompt fixed a regex bug.  The third prompt copied over css/img assets.  That was it.  Oh and the .CSS was all done by ChatGPT as well.  I asked for a simple css that looks good on mobile and this is what I got.  I'm a sucker for 80s retor sci-fi.</p><p>Anything prior to this post is from my old Hugo stuff.  I'll eventually bring that content over, what little there is.  Hopefully the easy of posting will get me writing more.</article>"
