Just to get in the habit of posting again I'm going to post some recipes that I (and the kids) like.  I'm usually looking these up and can never quite remember where I store them, so now I have content and a recipe hub.  You can find a variety of these "Roman French Toast" recipes on YouTube, but here's how I do it:

1. Pour whole milk into a bowl
1. Add whole egg and mix it into the milk
1. Add olive oil to a cast iron skillet and start heating to medium heat
1. Tear bread into bite-sized pieces.  The bread should be tough enough that it won't dissolve when it comes into contact with the milk
1. Soak each piece in the milk/egg mix, or if you want, paint both sides with a basting/pastry brush and then set them aside
1. Cook each piece for 1 to 2 minutes on each side in the cast iron skillet
    1. Your preference for crunchiness/doneness will dictate how long
1. Once all the pieces are cooked, pile them on a plate and drizzle with honey
1. If you have it on hand, sprinkle a wee bit of confectioners’ sugar on top
1. Try not to eat it all at once
