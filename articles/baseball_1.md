For the past few years my family has been following Major League Baseball.  It started when we all had covid and we started watching the Phillies playoff run in 2023.  We quickly adopted favorite players even though we didn't really know much about any of them.  It was fun family times. 

My two sons play little league now and the five of us still watch a lot of baseball.  My wife and I look at each other sometimes in bewilderment.  "Who are we?  We just talked for 20 minutes about possible minor leauge prospects."  I say all that to let you know that while I've been aware of baseball for my whole life (it was my father's favorite sport), I haven't really followed it until recently.  

Baseball is a game of stats that go way, way back.
