First off, let's so some *basic* things with text to see if **markdown** renders it correctly.  So far so good.  I'll put that in __underline__, or is it _underline_?.  I want to see what we can ~~strike out~~.  Lastly, I want to see if we can do a link and or an image.  The link will be to [jonwear.com](https://jonwear.com) and the image will be ![hero image](/images/hero2.png).

> Let's look at quotes and things like that.

```go
    var i = 0
```

`This could be kind of set apart.`

```js

alert('Hello!');

```

That is all, let's see how it renders.
