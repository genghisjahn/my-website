Continuing with our recipe series, let's go on to one of my favorite meals, the Rib-eye Steak.  There are gobs of videos and articles about the best way to cook a steak.  For me, the best way to cook it is one that doesn't require lots of time, doesn't make a mess and tastes great.  Here's what I've landed on.

1. Get a good rib-eye steak, for whatever your definition of good is
1. Let it sit out for 20 minutes
1. Pat it dry with a paper towel (both sides, the edges)
1. Lightly coat it with canola oil (or whatever oil you prefer)
1. Season with lots of salt & some pepper (I add more salt than pepper)
1. Put it in a cast iron skillet and turn to medium-high heat
    1. This cold sear technique will take a little bit longer, but it doesn't produce nearly as much smoke and mess.
    1. See [Lan Lam's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJcO1W_TD74) for details
1. Cook around 2 minutes on each side on med-high heat
1. Keep cooking 1 minute on each side until done on low heat
    1. It won't "look right" the first few times you flip, it takes longer to get all the Maillard reaction stuff
1. Optional, add butter/garlic to baste towards the end.  I sometimes forget to do this.
1. Let it sit five minutes
1. Eat it all!
